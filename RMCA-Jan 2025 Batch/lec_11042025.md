# 🧪 Research Methodologies – Session Summary

This document outlines the key learnings from the lecture on research methodologies, including explanations, examples, and external resources for deeper understanding.

## 📘 General Understanding

- **Approach vs Methodology**:
  - *Approach* is broader; it's the overall plan (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed).
  - *Methodology* is the specific way you collect and analyze data within that approach.

---

## 🔍 Qualitative Research Methodologies

### 1. **Case Study**
- In-depth examination of an individual, group, or event.
- Common in business, education, sociology.
- **Limitation**: Limited generalizability.
- **Example**: Studying the impact of a new teaching method in one school.
- 🔗 Resource: Yin, R. K. (2017). *Case Study Research and Applications*

---

### 2. **Grounded Theory**
- Data → Hypothesis (inductive).
- Theory *emerges* from data rather than testing a pre-existing one.
- **Example**: Interviews with elderly on technology use → derive theory.
- 🔗 [Grounded Theory Review](http://groundedtheoryreview.com/)

---

### 3. **Ethnography**
- Study of culture by immersion (researcher lives with the group).
- Uses participant observation, field notes, unstructured interviews.
- **Example**: Studying the Gon tribe in India.
- 🔗 Emerson, R. M. et al. *Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes*

---

### 4. **Phenomenology**
- Understand lived experience of individuals about a specific phenomenon.
- Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis.
- **Example**: First-time motherhood experiences.
- 🔗 Moustakas, C. (1994). *Phenomenological Research Methods*

---

### 5. **Narrative Research**
- Personal stories as data (journals, interviews, photos, etc.).
- Focus on meaning-making through narratives.
- **Example**: Refugee children’s adaptation to school in the US.
- 🔗 Clandinin, D. J., & Connelly, F. M. *Narrative Inquiry*

---

### 6. **Discourse Analysis**
- Studies how language is used to construct meaning and power structures.
- Often used in media, politics, literature.
- **Example**: Newspaper framing of Rohingya vs Myanmar military.
- 🔗 Fairclough, N. (1995). *Critical Discourse Analysis*

---

### 7. **Action Research**
- Collaborative, problem-solving, iterative.
- Used widely in education and management.
- **Example**: Evaluating parent-teacher communication tools in schools.
- 🔗 [Action Research Network](https://www.actionresearch.net/)

---

## 📊 Quantitative Research Methodologies

### 8. **Experimental Design**
- Hypothesis → variable manipulation → observe outcomes.
- High internal validity.
- **Example**: Little Albert's fear conditioning experiment.
- 🔗 Creswell, J. W. (2014). *Research Design*

---

### 9. **Non-Experimental Design**
- Observational studies. No variable manipulation.
- **Example**: Study correlation between income and education.
- Useful for real-world, ethical limitations.

---

### 10. **Cross-Sectional Design**
- Snapshot at one point in time.
- **Limitation**: No temporal analysis.
- **Example**: Survey of consumer preferences in 2024.

---

### 11. **Longitudinal Design**
- Data collected over time.
- **Example**: Studying consumer behavior every 6 months for 2 years.
- Offers insights into **change and development**.

---

### 12. **Quasi-Experimental Design**
- Pre-determined groups; not randomized.
- Appears like experimental but lacks full control.
- **Example**: Comparing two classes using different math apps.

---

### 13. **Correlation Research**
- Analyzes relationships between variables using statistical methods.
- Uses Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
- Types: Positive, Negative, None, Illusory.
- **Example**: Sugar intake vs obesity.
- 🔗 [Khan Academy – Correlation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

---

## 🔁 Mixed Methods

### 14. **Sequential Explanatory Design**
- **Quantitative → Qualitative**
- First gather data, then explain patterns using qualitative methods.
- **Example**: River pollution survey → interview locals.
- 🔗 Creswell, J. W. *Mixed Methods Research*

---

### 15. **Sequential Exploratory Design**
- **Qualitative → Quantitative**
- First explore with qualitative data, then validate with quantitative.
- **Example**: Identifying high pollution areas qualitatively, then testing them quantitatively.
