# Lecture: Research Process and Research Methodology
**Date:** April 26, 2025

## Detailed Learnings:

### 1. Difference Between Research Method and Research Methodology:
- **Research Methods:** Specific tools, techniques, instruments for data collection and analysis (e.g., surveys, PH meters).
- **Research Methodology:** The overall framework governing how research is designed and conducted.

### 2. Research Onion Model:
- **Layers include:**
  - Research Philosophy
  - Research Approach (Deductive vs Inductive)
  - Research Strategies (e.g., surveys, case studies)
  - Research Choices (Mono-method, Mixed-methods)
  - Time Horizons (Cross-sectional vs Longitudinal)
  - Data Collection and Analysis techniques

### 3. Research Process Phases:
- **Phase 1: Deciding**
  - Formulating research problem, setting research questions and objectives.
- **Phase 2: Planning**
  - Designing methodology, selecting sampling techniques, data collection planning.
- **Phase 3: Execution**
  - Collecting data, analyzing results, interpreting outcomes.

### 4. Importance of Proper Planning:
- Ensures alignment with aims, available resources, and feasibility of study.
- Early clarity about variables, hypotheses, and methods saves time later.
- Understanding ethical issues, accessibility of data, and defining achievable objectives is critical.

### 5. Understanding Variables and Hypotheses:
- **Variables:** Measurable aspects affected by the study (e.g., plant height, income levels).
- **Hypotheses:** Tentative statements predicting the relationship between variables.
- Hypotheses must be simple, clear, verifiable, and linked to prior research.

- [Research Methods vs Methodology (ProjectGuru)](https://www.projectguru.in/research-methods-vs-research-methodology/)

## Commentary:
The lecture gave a very methodical walkthrough of how a research project should be designed from scratch. The "Research Onion" was an excellent framework to visualize how multiple layers contribute to a coherent research study.
