## 2. Scientific Integrity & Ethical Violations
- **Plagiarism, falsification, and fabrication** undermine the scientific process.
- Ethical concerns also include **redundant publications** and **selective reporting**.
- Institutions and journals use **plagiarism detection tools** and enforce **strict authorship guidelines**.

### 📌 Example:
- **Jan Hendrik Schön Scandal** – A physicist’s fabricated research papers were retracted after misconduct was discovered.

---

## 3. Ethical Dilemmas in Research
- Conflict arises between **truth vs. kindness**, **moral vs. non-moral values**.
- Researchers should prioritize **ethical transparency** over personal or institutional gains.

### 📌 Case Study:
