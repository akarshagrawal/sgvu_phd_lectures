# 🧪 Learnings from Research Ethics Class – April 13 (Dr. Divya Singh)

## 🧠 Core Topics and Takeaways

| **Topic** | **Key Learning** | **Additional Commentary & Resources** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **1. Scientific Ethics** | Ethics in research include honesty, objectivity, integrity, confidentiality, social responsibility, etc. | ✅ [ORI's Introduction to the Responsible Conduct of Research](https://ori.hhs.gov/ori-introduction-responsible-conduct-research) |
| **2. Case Study on Data Fabrication** | PhD student fabricates data under pressure; class was divided into role-play groups (researchers, assistants, editors, public, ethics committee). | 🎯 Role-play helps simulate real-life dilemmas. Try similar activities from [Online Ethics Center](https://onlineethics.org/cases/research-ethics-cases). |
| **3. Consequences of Misconduct** | Leads to degree revocation, blacklisting, loss of funding, reputational damage to institutions. | ⚠️ [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) highlights real-world examples like Ashok Pandey’s 44 retracted papers. |
| **4. Types of Research Misconduct** | - **Fabrication**: Making up data<br> - **Distortion**: Manipulating procedures<br> - **Plagiarism**: Copy-pasting or using others' work without credit | 📘 Refer to [COPE Guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/) for deeper journal publication ethics. |
| **5. Role of Ethics Committees** | Should monitor, investigate, and take responsibility for maintaining fairness and integrity. | 🏛 UGC and NIH recommend regular institutional ethics training. |
| **6. Authorship & Publication Ethics** | Clarify roles: First author = key contributor, Corresponding author = communicates with journals. Disputes can arise. | 🖋 Use [ICMJE guidelines](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/) to prevent conflicts. |
| **7. Collaborative & Interdisciplinary Research** | Requires openness, clear contribution policies, dual-institutional compliance. | 🧬 [Nature's collaboration policies](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies) are a great resource. |
| **8. Record Keeping** | Maintain lab logbooks, organize and preserve raw data and methods. | 📚 Refer to NIH’s Data Management Toolkit. |
| **9. Reporting Misconduct** | Speak up even if not directly impacted; silence contributes to unethical culture. | 🗣 Institutions should have anonymous reporting channels. |
| **10. Ethical Foundations** | Truth, transparency, and accountability are non-negotiable in research. | 🧭 These values build the credibility and replicability of scientific knowledge. |
