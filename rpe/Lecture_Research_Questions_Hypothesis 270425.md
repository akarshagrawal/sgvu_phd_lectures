# Lecture: Research Question and Hypothesis Building
**Date:** April 27, 2025

## Detailed Learnings:

### 1. Understanding Research Questions:
- A research question is the backbone of any research article, thesis, or dissertation.
- It defines the study area (management, education, agriculture, etc.) and specifies the research problem.
- Good research questions should be:
  - Specific and clearly defined
  - Researchable using available methods
  - Focused on a single problem
  - Feasible in terms of available resources

### 2. Formulating Hypotheses:
- Hypotheses stem from research questions and act as predictive statements.
- Two main types:
  - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** No relationship or effect exists.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** A relationship or effect does exist.
- Example: Testing whether climate change impacts agricultural crop yield.

### 3. Literature Review Importance:
- Review of past studies helps in identifying research gaps and framing strong questions.
- Literature review should cover journal articles, book chapters, scientific reports, and credible sources.

### 4. Tools Introduced:
- **VOSviewer:** Software for bibliometric mapping and literature network analysis.
- Hands-on training to download and use VOSviewer was discussed.

### 5. Building Strong Research Questions:
- Field knowledge is crucial.
- Accessible data and feasible data collection methods must be ensured.
- Background questions (5Ws and 1H: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) were emphasized.

## Commentary:
This session clearly emphasized practical aspects of choosing a viable research question. The glacier study anecdote underlined how logistical constraints must shape research planning.
